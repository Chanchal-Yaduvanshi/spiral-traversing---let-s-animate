# spiral-traversing---let-s-animate
This Python script utilizes the Turtle module to animate the spiral traversal of a grid. The grid size is determined by the parameters R (number of rows) and C (number of columns).

Here's a breakdown of how the animation works:

**Turtle Setup:**
The Turtle module is used to create a turtle object tur.
The background color is set to black.
The pen is lifted up to avoid drawing while moving.

**Spiral Traversal Function:**
It takes two arguments: m (number of rows) and n (number of columns).
The function iterates through the grid, printing the first row, last column, last row (in reverse order), and first column (in reverse order) in a spiral pattern.
Random colors are selected for each traversal to add visual interest.

**Animation:**
The spiral function is called with the specified grid size (R rows and C columns).
As the turtle moves and prints dots, the grid traversal is animated on the screen.

**End of Animation:**
The Turtle screen is kept open until it is manually closed by the user.
